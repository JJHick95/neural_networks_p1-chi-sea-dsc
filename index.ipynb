Given that the **output** is zero when negative, some nodes become inactive (i.e. produce an output of 0).  Zero outputs take little computational power. Also, the constant gradient leads to faster learning in comparison to sigmoid and tanh, which come close to 0 with large positive and negative values.  Since the speed of our network is linked to the derivative, a derivative close to zero will result in very slow learning."]}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "cloud_for_class", "language": "python", "name": "cloud_for_class"}, "language_info": {"codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "file_extension": ".py", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "name": "python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "version": "3.7.6"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 4}
